# RescU
In the world of livestock, animals that are no longer of use to farmers wind up at auctions, where they are cramped in holding pens and left to trample one another until they are either killed, bought, or shipped off to slaughter. In addition to these harrowing places, animals also experience cruelty from birth when they are ripped from their mothers to be shipped away to slaughter,  or are victims of general neglect, hoarding, or natural disasters (such as the recent flooding in Texas). To battle the cruelty that is rampant in the livestock industry, animal rescue organizations often try to save animals from these scenarios, but lack a coordinated and centralized way to do so.

Thatâ€™s exactly what RescU aims to be: a platform for animal advocates to identify and monitor potential rescue missions, centralizing information and allowing coordination between different organizations. An application like this would be vital to the rescue industry and invaluable to the animals whose lives are at risk. Rescue operations are highly time-sensitive and information sent over social media platforms often gets lost in the high volume of inbox messages and mentions. A platform dedicated specifically to facilitating rescue increases response time and has the potential to save countless lives.
